# THE NATURE OF CINDER

An adoptation of Daniel Shiffman's [text](http://natureofcode.com/book) towards establishing a Creative-Coding workflow with [Cinder](http://libcinder.org).

(Cinder 0.8.5 / XCode 5.0.1 / [Wiki](https://github.com/ilzxc/The-Nature-of-Cinder/wiki) updated frequently)

Warning: I updated my IDE to the newest version and will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that all of the xcode projects are adequately migrated. Due to the new versions of LLVM compilers shipped with Xcode 5.*, I had to rebuild Cinder for the new system. Once the migration of older examples is complete, I'll update the wiki with all the relevant information for building & running examples. For now, XCode 5 users are advised to rebuild Cinder in order for things to work correctly.
