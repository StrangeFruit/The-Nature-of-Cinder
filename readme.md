# THE NATURE OF CINDER

An adoptation of Daniel Shiffman's [text](http://natureofcode.com/book) towards establishing a Creative-Coding workflow [Cinder](http://libcinder.org).

**Warning: due to the fact that I updated my Cinder install to 0.8.5 shortly after I started work on this, Chapters 1 and 2 may not compile (though the contents of `/src` can most certainly be used to build Cinder 0.8.5 apps). This warning is mostly here for myself to remember to fix this.**
